# .NET Backend Developer Roadmap for 2023

Hey there ðŸ‘‹. This is my roadmap for .NET developers that want to focus on backend and specifically work with microservices and cloud.

I will try to keep updating this roadmap as the technology landscape is evolving.

I have created courses on several of the topics outlined in the roadmap so if you're interested in learning more about those topics then check my courses out:
